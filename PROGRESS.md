# Progress

Build order follows `finance-tracker-spec.md` section 6. One phase per commit.

## Decisions (apply to all phases)

- Money is `Decimal` with two places, never float. Rendered as a JSON string (`"12.40"`) so clients never touch binary floats.
- Schema changes between phases use `SQLModel.metadata.create_all` only. When a phase changes the schema, recreate the volume (`docker compose down -v`). No Alembic.
- "Today" for summaries comes from the client's timezone, sent with the request. No server-side default timezone.
- Categories are per user: a seeded default set plus the user's own custom ones.

## Phase 1 — Core skeleton

**Status:** done, awaiting owner verification

**Delivered:** FastAPI app, `GET /health`, `Expense` model (Decimal price, date, optional description, status enum), `POST /expenses`, `GET /expenses`, `GET /expenses/{id}` backed by an in-memory store injected via `Depends`.

**Verified:** every endpoint hit with curl; 201 on create, 200 on reads, 404 on unknown id, 422 on negative price, more than two decimal places, non-integer id. Client-supplied `status` is ignored (always `confirmed`).

**Known gaps:** data lives in process memory and is lost on restart (by design, phase 2 fixes). No PATCH/DELETE/filters until phase 4. No categories until phase 3.

## Phase 2 — Persistence

**Status:** not started
